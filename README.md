# CPSC221
Assignments from my CPSC221 Class at UBC.

PA1: Implementing functions to render/produce an image represented as a "two dimensional linked list".

PA2: Applying stacks and queues with DFS and BFS to explore flood fill algorithms and using inheritance and C++ constructs.

PA3: Implementing images using a binary tree with complex recursive algorithms and performing image compression using space-partitioning trees.
